# TaskPenguin-Helper

### Overview

TaskPenguin is a solution for everyone with **any** amount of bills to pay that works by providing them with an automated system that makes the payments they once needed to go to an actual bank to pay, risking their safety, by carrying huge sums of money and wasting time waiting in loooooong lines.

The purpose of this script is to fetch bills on the official websites, send them to our AWS server so they can later be managed and paid
